		<h2>Browsers, Flash and non-latin text input</h2>

		<p>Although the fairly well know WMODE set to opaque/transparent non-US keyboard bug that existed for many years has been fixed by most browser vendors there remains some territory that has not yet been successfully crossed.</p>

		<p>Some non-latin languages (greek, russian, hebrew) still get a rough time with Flash keyboard input when WMODE is set to anything other than <var>window</var> (the default). Hitting a single key yields two garbled characters in Internet Explorer and in Chrome or Firefox the application shows output as if a US keyboard was used.</p>

		<p>Below is a simple text box to try things out for yourself. First a flash object with wmode set to default (which is window), second with wmode set to opaque and finally transparent. There should be no difference between opaque and transparent.</p>

		<h3>wmode = 'window'</h3>
		<div id="windowed">
			<p>a Flash textbox will load here with wmode = 'window'.</p>
		</div>
		<p>This piece of flash has the default wmode, you can type using any keyboard setting and see the characters you expect.</p>

		<h3>wmode = 'opaque'</h3>
		<div id="opaque">
			<p>a Flash textbox will load here with wmode = 'opaque'.</p>
		</div>
		<p>This piece of flash has wmode set to opaque, if you're keyboard is set to a language like greek you'll find that the characters that appear are those corrisponding with a US keyboard layout.</p>

		<h3>wmode = 'transparent'</h3>
		<div id="transparent">
			<p>a Flash textbox will load here with wmode = 'transparent'.</p>
		</div>
		<p>This one has the wmode set to transparent, you should get the same results as the opaque one.</p>
