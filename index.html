	<h1>Browsers, Flash and non-latin text input</h1>

	<p>Although the fairly well know WMODE set to opaque/transparent non-US keyboard bug that existed for many years has been fixed by most browser vendors there remains some territory that has not yet been successfully crossed.</p>

	<p>Some non-latin languages (greek, russian, hebrew) still get a rough time with Flash keyboard input when WMODE is set to anything other than <var>window</var> (the default). Hitting a single key yields two garbled characters in Internet Explorer and in Chrome or Firefox the application shows output as if a US keyboard was used.</p>

	<p>Below is a simple text box to try things out for yourself. First a flash object with wmode set to default (which is window), second with wmode set to opaque and finally transparent. There should be no difference between opaque and transparent.</p>

	<h2>wmode = 'window'</h2>
	<div id="windowed">
		<p>a Flash textbox will load here with wmode = 'window'.</p>
	</div>

	<h2>wmode = 'opaque'</h2>
	<div id="opaque">
		<p>a Flash textbox will load here with wmode = 'opaque'.</p>
	</div>

	<h2>wmode = 'transparent'</h2>
	<div id="transparent">
		<p>a Flash textbox will load here with wmode = 'transparent'.</p>
	</div>


	<script type = "text/javascript">
	var flashvars = {};
	var attribute = {};
	
	swfobject.embedSWF("resources/textbox.swf", "windowed", "300", "140", "9.0.0",null, flashvars, {wmode: 'window'}, attribute);
	swfobject.embedSWF("resources/textbox.swf", "opaque", "300", "140", "9.0.0",null, flashvars, {wmode: 'opaque'}, attribute);
	swfobject.embedSWF("resources/textbox.swf", "transparent", "300", "140", "9.0.0",null, flashvars, {wmode: 'transparent'}, attribute);
	</script>
